# The Geographic Diversity Project
_Providing the Economics community with information on the geographic diversity of journals._

## Summary
Data provided here contains the name, institutional affiliation and geographic location of editorial staff at journals ranked **A*** by the [2019 ABDC Journal Quality List](https://abdc.edu.au/research/abdc-journal-list/).

## Details
Data is taken from the official websites of the journals in question. The journals included are the complete set of **A*** journals in economics (codes 1401,1402,1403) according to the Australian Business Deans Council (ABDC) 2019 Journal Quality List.

Included in the data are people listed as having current editorial positions at the journals. We exclude positions clearly marked as honorary or no longer active (e.g. “Former editor”).

If person X is listed as performing an editorial function for journal Y, there will be a single line of data corresponding to this. If person X is listed by multiple journals, he or she will be included in multiple lines of data.

If a person’s affiliation or affiliations is listed on the journal website, these affiliations will be included in the relevant line of data. If a person’s affiliation or affiliations are not listed on the journal website, the affiliations listed were found by conducting an internet search.
