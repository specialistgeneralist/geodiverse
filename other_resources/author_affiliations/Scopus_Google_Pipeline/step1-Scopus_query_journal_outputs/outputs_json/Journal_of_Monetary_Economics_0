We extend Khwaja and Mian's (2008) loan-level estimator by incorporating firm-level general equilibrium adjustments. Higher ex-ante bank real-estate exposure increases credit supply to non-real-estate firms, but effects are neutralized by firm-level adjustments for firms with existing banking relationships. However, higher bank real-estate exposure increases risk-taking, by relaxing standards of existing borrowers (cheaper, longer-term and less collateralized credit), and by expanding credit on the extensive margin to first-time borrowers that default substantially more. Results suggest that the mechanism at work is greater liquidity via securitization of real-estate assets.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true",

Responding to their incentives, income fund managers tend to aggressively over-weight high dividend stocks in a low-rate environment.

The main advantage of price level stabilization compared with inflation stabilization rests on the central bank's ability to shape expectations. We show that stabilizing prices is no longer optimal when the central bank can shape expectations of agents with incomplete knowledge, who have to learn about the policy implemented. Disinflating in the short run more than agents expect generates short-term gains without triggering an abrupt loss of confidence, because agents update expectations sluggishly. Following this policy, in the long run, the central bank loses the ability to shape agents’ beliefs, and the economy converges to a rational expectations equilibrium in which policy does not stabilize prices, economic volatility is high, and agents suffer the corresponding welfare losses. However, these losses are outweighed by short-term gains from the learning phase.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60082963","afid":"60082963","affilname":"Banca d'Italia","affiliation-city":"Rome","affiliation-country":"Italy"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025233","afid":"60025233","affilname":"NHH Norwegian School of Economics","affiliation-city":"Bergen","affiliation-country":"Norway"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021097","afid":"60021097","affilname":"University of Surrey","affiliation-city":"Guildford","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56235625600","authid":"56235625600","authname":"Mele A.","surname":"Mele","given-name":"Antonio","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021097"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23028428800","authid":"23028428800","authname":"Molnár K.","surname":"Molnár","given-name":"Krisztina","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025233"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55972647900","authid":"55972647900","authname":"Santoro S.","surname":"Santoro","given-name":"Sergio","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60082963"}]}],"authkeywords":"Inflation stabilization | Learning | Optimal monetary policy | Price level stabilization","source-id":"17555","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85071268937"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85071268937?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85071268937&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85071268937&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0304393219301370"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85071268937","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85071268937","eid":"2-s2.0-85071268937","dc:title":"Inequality and financial fragility","dc:creator":"Mitkov Y.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Monetary Economics","prism:issn":"03043932","prism:volume":"115","prism:pageRange":"233-248","prism:coverDate":"2020-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"November 2020","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.jmoneco.2019.08.004","pii":"S0304393219301370","dc:description":"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Exploiting the German reunification, we study how households adapt to a new environment in their macroeconomic forecasting.

These differences are likely driven by the persistent effect of the inflation shock after reunification, which contrasted strongly with experiences of zero inflation in the GDR. East Germans’ higher inflation expectations are reflected in higher consumer debt and lower bond holdings. Our findings suggest that large changes in the environment can permanently impede people's ability to form expectations, with an important role for the interaction of experiences before and after the event.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60102529","afid":"60102529","affilname":"Deutsche Bundesbank","affiliation-city":"Frankfurt am Main","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030840","afid":"60030840","affilname":"Københavns Universitet","affiliation-city":"Copenhagen","affiliation-country":"Denmark"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007762","afid":"60007762","affilname":"Goethe-Universität Frankfurt am Main","affiliation-city":"Frankfurt am Main","affiliation-country":"Germany"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57210554214","authid":"57210554214","authname":"Goldfayn-Frank O.","surname":"Goldfayn-Frank","given-name":"Olga","initials":"O.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007762"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60102529"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57190376381","authid":"57190376381","authname":"Wohlfart J.","surname":"Wohlfart","given-name":"Johannes","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030840"}]}],"authkeywords":"Expectation formation | German reunification | Inflation | Macroeconomic experiences | Natural experiment","source-id":"17555","fund-acr":"DFG","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85069808484"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85069808484?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85069808484&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85069808484&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0304393218301661"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85069808484","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85069808484","eid":"2-s2.0-85069808484","dc:title":"Monetary policy uncertainty","dc:creator":"Husted L.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Monetary Economics","prism:issn":"03043932","prism:volume":"115","prism:pageRange":"20-36","prism:coverDate":"2020-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"November 2020","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.jmoneco.2019.07.009","pii":"S0304393218301661","dc:description":"© 2019 We construct a new measure of uncertainty about Federal Reserve policy actions and their consequences, a monetary policy uncertainty (MPU) index.

This paper investigates the determinants of monetary stability in Europe from the late medieval era until World War I. Through this period, the anchor for monetary policy was the silver or gold value of the monetary unit. States, however, frequently abandoned this anchor, some depreciating their monetary units against silver and gold less than 10-fold and others more than 10,000-fold between 1500 and 1914. To understand the determinants of these differences, we compile a new and comprehensive monetary history dataset for all major states in Europe and test alternative theories. We find strong evidence that political factors, and in particular, fiscal capacity, political regime and warfare explain patterns of monetary stability. This finding is robust to addressing endogeneity, controlling for the instability induced by the mechanics of the monetary system and accounting for the impacts of new monetary technologies and the advent of fiat standard.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60104489","afid":"60104489","affilname":"Altinbas Universitesi","affiliation-city":"Istanbul","affiliation-country":"Turkey"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005803","afid":"60005803","affilname":"Bogaziçi Üniversitesi","affiliation-city":"Istanbul","affiliation-country":"Turkey"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57209030626","authid":"57209030626","authname":"Karaman K.K.","surname":"Karaman","given-name":"K.

During the Great Recession, central banks lowered their policy rate to the zero lower bound (ZLB), calling into question linear estimation methods. There are two alternatives: estimate a nonlinear model that accounts for precautionary savings effects of the ZLB or a piecewise linear model that is faster but ignores the precautionary savings effects. This paper compares their accuracy using artificial datasets. The predictions of the nonlinear model are typically more accurate than the piecewise linear model, but the differences are usually small. There are far larger gains in accuracy from estimating a richer, less misspecified piecewise linear model.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016114","afid":"60016114","affilname":"William &amp; Mary","affiliation-city":"Williamsburg","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008845","afid":"60008845","affilname":"Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas","affiliation-city":"Dallas","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57205263624","authid":"57205263624","authname":"Atkinson T.","surname":"Atkinson","given-name":"Tyler","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008845"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55235088600","authid":"55235088600","authname":"Richter A.W.","surname":"Richter","given-name":"Alexander W.","initials":"A.W.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008845"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55848617400","authid":"55848617400","authname":"Throckmorton N.A.","surname":"Throckmorton","given-name":"Nathaniel A.","initials":"N.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016114"}]}],"authkeywords":"Bayesian estimation | Inversion filter | Occbin | Particle filter | Projection methods","source-id":"17555","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85068092594"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85068092594?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85068092594&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85068092594&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0304393219300947"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85068092594","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85068092594","eid":"2-s2.0-85068092594","dc:title":"Adverse selection, lemons shocks and business cycles","dc:creator":"Ikeda D.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Monetary Economics","prism:issn":"03043932","prism:volume":"115","prism:pageRange":"94-112","prism:coverDate":"2020-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"November 2020","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.jmoneco.2019.05.005","pii":"S0304393219300947","dc:description":"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

A dynamic model featuring a stochastic technology frontier shows significant impact of technology adoption for asset prices. In equilibrium, firms operating with old capital are riskier because costly technology adoption restricts their flexibility in upgrading to the latest technology, making them more exposed to technology frontier shocks. Consistent with the model predictions, a long-short portfolio sorted on firm-level capital age earns an average value-weighted return of 9% per year among U.S. public companies. A proxy for technology frontier shocks captures the variation of the capital age portfolios with a positive risk price, corroborating the model mechanism.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60123802","afid":"60123802","affilname":"Carlson School of Management","affiliation-city":"Minneapolis","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023612","afid":"60023612","affilname":"Federal Reserve System","affiliation-city":"Washington, D.C.","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022659","afid":"60022659","affilname":"University of Connecticut","affiliation-city":"Storrs","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55571491200","authid":"55571491200","authname":"Lin X.","surname":"Lin","given-name":"Xiaoji","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60123802"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/54879415700","authid":"54879415700","authname":"Palazzo B.","surname":"Palazzo","given-name":"Berardino","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023612"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203220348","authid":"57203220348","authname":"Yang F.","surname":"Yang","given-name":"Fan","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022659"}]}],"authkeywords":"Capital age | Stock returns | Technology adoption | Technology frontier shocks","source-id":"17555","fund-acr":"BU","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Boston University","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85067193439"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85067193439?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85067193439&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85067193439&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0304393219300959"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85067193439","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85067193439","eid":"2-s2.0-85067193439","dc:title":"Austerity in the aftermath of the great recession","dc:creator":"House C.L.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Monetary Economics","prism:issn":"03043932","prism:volume":"115","prism:pageRange":"37-63","prism:coverDate":"2020-11-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"November 2020","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.jmoneco.2019.05.004","pii":"S0304393219300959","dc:description":"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The quantitative easing (QE) policies implemented in recent years by central banks have had a profound impact on the working of money markets, giving rise to large excess reserves and pushing down key interbank rates against their floor – the interest rate on reserves. With macroeconomic fundamentals improving, central banks now face the dilemma as to whether to maintain this large balance sheet/floor system, or else to reduce their balance sheet size towards pre-crisis trends and operate traditional corridor systems. We address this issue using a New Keynesian model featuring heterogeneous banks that trade funds in an interbank market characterized by matching frictions. In this environment, balance sheet expansions push market rates towards their floor by slackening the interbank market. A large balance sheet regime is found to deliver ampler ‘policy space’ by widening the steady-state distance between the interest on reserves and its effective lower bound (ELB). Nonetheless, a lean-balance-sheet regime that resorts to temporary but prompt QE in response to recessions severe enough for the ELB to bind achieves similar stabilization and welfare outcomes as a large-balance-sheet regime in which interest-rate policy is the primary adjustment margin thanks to the larger policy space.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60109587","afid":"60109587","affilname":"Banco de España","affiliation-city":"Madrid","affiliation-country":"Spain"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23092914400","authid":"23092914400","authname":"Arce Ó.","surname":"Arce","given-name":"Óscar","initials":"Ó.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60109587"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/37097922900","authid":"37097922900","authname":"Nuño G.","surname":"Nuño","given-name":"Galo","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60109587"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57208707614","authid":"57208707614","authname":"Thaler D.","surname":"Thaler","given-name":"Dominik","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60109587"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24339473400","authid":"24339473400","authname":"Thomas C.","surname":"Thomas","given-name":"Carlos","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60109587"}]}],"authkeywords":"Central bank balance sheet | Interbank market | Reserves | Search and matching frictions | Zero lower bound","source-id":"17555","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85065059042"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85065059042?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85065059042&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85065059042&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0304393219300480"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85065059042","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85065059042","eid":"2-s2.0-85065059042","dc:title":"Monetary policy shocks from the consumer perspective","dc:creator":"Claus E.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Monetary Economics","prism:issn":"03043932","prism:volume":"114","prism:pageRange":"159-173","prism:coverDate":"2020-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"October 2020","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.jmoneco.2019.03.012","pii":"S0304393219300480","dc:description":"© 2019 Elsevier B.V. Applying a latent factor model to survey expectations data on economic conditions, unemployment, family finances, and readiness to spend reveals that, following a monetary policy shock, consumer expectations adjust in the direction predicted by standard models. Further, expectations respond asymmetrically to policy tightenings or easings, are sluggish, and are consistent with an income channel of monetary policy. Inflation expectations are at first anchored, but significantly adjust in the long run, in a way that is consistent with a Delphic effect of monetary policy. Expectations are heterogeneous according to gender, income, and housing status in systematic ways.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026553","afid":"60026553","affilname":"University of Melbourne","affiliation-city":"Parkville","affiliation-country":"Australia"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000521","afid":"60000521","affilname":"Wilfrid Laurier University","affiliation-city":"Waterloo","affiliation-country":"Canada"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24333932700","authid":"24333932700","authname":"Claus E.","surname":"Claus","given-name":"Edda","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000521"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55056628500","authid":"55056628500","authname":"Nguyen V.H.","surname":"Nguyen","given-name":"Viet Hoang","initials":"V.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026553"}]}],"authkeywords":"Expectations formation | Heterogeneous consumers | Latent factor model | Monetary policy shocks | Nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag model","source-id":"17555","fund-no":"2015FRG","fund-sponsor":"University of Melbourne","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
