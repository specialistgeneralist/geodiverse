The Great Depression regime implies a collapse of the stock market, with small-growth stocks outperforming small-value stocks.

Using a New Keynesian model, with search and matching labour frictions and Epstein-Zin preferences we show that these volatility effects are driven by the coexistence of agents’ fears of unemployment and concerns about the (in) ability of the monetary authority to reverse deviations from the policy rule with the impact magnified by the agents’ preferences.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60170149","afid":"60170149","affilname":"Cardiff Business School","affiliation-city":"Cardiff","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022109","afid":"60022109","affilname":"Queen Mary University of London","affiliation-city":"London","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/26023587900","authid":"26023587900","authname":"Mumtaz H.","surname":"Mumtaz","given-name":"Haroon","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022109"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24330154100","authid":"24330154100","authname":"Theodoridis K.","surname":"Theodoridis","given-name":"Konstantinos","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60170149"}]}],"authkeywords":"DSGE | Epstein-Zin preferences | New keynesian | Non-Linear SVAR | Search and matching frictions | Stochastic volatility","source-id":"17555","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063564120"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063564120?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85063564120&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85063564120&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0304393219300522"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063564120","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85063564120","eid":"2-s2.0-85063564120","dc:title":"The optimal composition of public spending in a deep recession","dc:creator":"Bouakez H.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Monetary Economics","prism:issn":"03043932","prism:volume":"114","prism:pageRange":"334-349","prism:coverDate":"2020-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"October 2020","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.jmoneco.2019.03.006","pii":"S0304393219300522","dc:description":"© 2019 Elsevier B.V. We study optimal fiscal policy in an economy plunged into a deep recession characterized by a liquidity trap, and in which the government can allocate spending both to consumption and investment goods. Public investment increases the stock of public capital subject to a time-to-build constraint. The zero lower bound on the nominal interest rate binds as a result of a large shock that increases households’ desire to save in the risk-free asset, pushing the natural rate of interest below zero. Under nominal rigidities and sub-optimal monetary policy, the shock leads to a large decline in private consumption and investment. We show that the optimal response to such a shock is to temporarily raise public spending above the level that would be dictated by classical principles, and to tilt its composition towards public investment. This compositional shift lasts well after the natural rate has ceased to be negative. Our results suggest that the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 was insufficiently oriented towards public investment.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030208","afid":"60030208","affilname":"Universite d' Evry Val d'Essonne","affiliation-city":"Evry","affiliation-country":"France"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017161","afid":"60017161","affilname":"National University of Singapore","affiliation-city":"Singapore City","affiliation-country":"Singapore"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60002970","afid":"60002970","affilname":"HEC Montréal","affiliation-city":"Montreal","affiliation-country":"Canada"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/17344967000","authid":"17344967000","authname":"Bouakez H.","surname":"Bouakez","given-name":"Hafedh","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60002970"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55619951100","authid":"55619951100","authname":"Guillard M.","surname":"Guillard","given-name":"Michel","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030208"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55928806000","authid":"55928806000","authname":"Roulleau-Pasdeloup J.","surname":"Roulleau-Pasdeloup","given-name":"Jordan","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017161"}]}],"authkeywords":"Optimal fiscal policy | Public consumption | Public investment | Time to build | Zero lower bound","source-id":"17555","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063487932"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063487932?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85063487932&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85063487932&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0304393219300534"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85063487932","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85063487932","eid":"2-s2.0-85063487932","dc:title":"Price dispersion and inflation: New facts and theoretical implications","dc:creator":"Sheremirov V.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Monetary Economics","prism:issn":"03043932","prism:volume":"114","prism:pageRange":"59-70","prism:coverDate":"2020-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"October 2020","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.jmoneco.2019.03.007","pii":"S0304393219300534","dc:description":"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The fiscal position can affect fiscal multipliers through two channels. Through the Ricardian channel, households reduce consumption in anticipation of future fiscal adjustments when fiscal stimulus is implemented from a weak fiscal position. Through the interest rate channel, fiscal stimulus from a weak fiscal position heightens investors’ concerns about sovereign credit risk, raises economy-wide borrowing cost, and reduces private domestic demand. We document empirically the relevance of these two channels using an Interactive Panel Vector Auto Regression model.

With uninsurable idiosyncratic uncertainty, this translates intertemporally—through compounding (discounting) in the aggregate Euler equation—into further amplification (dampening) of future shocks.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000239","afid":"60000239","affilname":"Université de Lausanne (UNIL)","affiliation-city":"Lausanne","affiliation-country":"Switzerland"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24167844000","authid":"24167844000","authname":"Bilbiie F.O.","surname":"Bilbiie","given-name":"Florin O.","initials":"F.O.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000239"}]}],"authkeywords":"Aggregate demand | Fiscal multipliers | Forward guidance | Hand-to-mouth | HANK | Heterogeneity | Keynesian cross | Monetary policy | Redistribution | TANK","source-id":"17555","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85062990929"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85062990929?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85062990929&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85062990929&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0304393219300479"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85062990929","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85062990929","eid":"2-s2.0-85062990929","dc:title":"Rules-based monetary policy and the threat of indeterminacy when trend inflation is low","dc:creator":"Khan H.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Monetary Economics","prism:issn":"03043932","prism:volume":"114","prism:pageRange":"317-333","prism:coverDate":"2020-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"October 2020","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.jmoneco.2019.03.001","pii":"S0304393219300479","dc:description":"© 2019 Elsevier B.V. Indeterminacy in new Keynesian models with Calvo-contracts can occur even at low trend inflation levels of 2% or 3%. The interaction of trend inflation with nominal wage rigidity and trend growth in output causes large distortions in the steady state and expands the indeterminacy region. Consequently, even interest rate rules with strong inflation responses may not be sufficient to ensure determinacy. A policy rule reacting to output growth but not to output gap significantly increases the prospect of determinacy. Although the threat of indeterminacy is less severe under Taylor-contracts, significant departures from the original Taylor Principle are required for determinacy.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027863","afid":"60027863","affilname":"Université du Québec à Montréal","affiliation-city":"Montreal","affiliation-country":"Canada"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60017592","afid":"60017592","affilname":"Carleton University","affiliation-city":"Ottawa","affiliation-country":"Canada"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7201739329","authid":"7201739329","authname":"Khan H.","surname":"Khan","given-name":"Hashmat","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60017592"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6602705631","authid":"6602705631","authname":"Phaneuf L.","surname":"Phaneuf","given-name":"Louis","initials":"L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027863"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57201638193","authid":"57201638193","authname":"Victor J.G.","surname":"Victor","given-name":"Jean Gardy","initials":"J.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027863"}]}],"authkeywords":"Determinacy | Low trend inflation | Output gap | Output growth | Sticky wages | Taylor rule | Trend growth","source-id":"17555","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85062675769"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85062675769?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85062675769&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85062675769&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0304393218303209"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85062675769","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85062675769","eid":"2-s2.0-85062675769","dc:title":"Job creation in tight and slack labor markets","dc:creator":"Buchheim L.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Monetary Economics","prism:issn":"03043932","prism:volume":"114","prism:pageRange":"126-143","prism:coverDate":"2020-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"October 2020","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.jmoneco.2019.02.006","pii":"S0304393218303209","dc:description":"© 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We simulate the dynamic effects of this refugee wave, with specific focus on the welfare impact on low skilled natives. Our results indicate that the small losses this group suffers can be compensated by welfare gains of other parts of the native population.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023020","afid":"60023020","affilname":"Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona","affiliation-city":"Barcelona","affiliation-country":"Spain"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007762","afid":"60007762","affilname":"Goethe-Universität Frankfurt am Main","affiliation-city":"Frankfurt am Main","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006297","afid":"60006297","affilname":"University of Pennsylvania","affiliation-city":"Philadelphia","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57216755211","authid":"57216755211","authname":"Busch C.","surname":"Busch","given-name":"Christopher","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023020"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8074882100","authid":"8074882100","authname":"Krueger D.","surname":"Krueger","given-name":"Dirk","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006297"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56714906800","authid":"56714906800","authname":"Ludwig A.","surname":"Ludwig","given-name":"Alexander","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007762"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57216755146","authid":"57216755146","authname":"Popova I.","surname":"Popova","given-name":"Irina","initials":"I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007762"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57209348473","authid":"57209348473","authname":"Iftikhar Z.","surname":"Iftikhar","given-name":"Zainab","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007762"}]}],"authkeywords":"Demographic change | Immigration | Overlapping generations | Refugees","source-id":"17555","fund-acr":"UAB","fund-no":"SES 1757084","fund-sponsor":"University of Alabama at Birmingham","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85084199504"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85084199504?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85084199504&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85084199504&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0304393220300544"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85084199504","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85084199504","eid":"2-s2.0-85084199504","dc:title":"Migration and sovereign default risk","dc:creator":"Alessandria G.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Monetary Economics","prism:issn":"03043932","prism:volume":"113","prism:pageRange":"1-22","prism:coverDate":"2020-08-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"August 2020","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.jmoneco.2020.04.007","pii":"S0304393220300544","dc:description":"© 2020 Elsevier B.V. During sovereign debt crises, countries experience persistent economic declines, spiking spreads, and outflows of capital and workers. To account for these salient features, we develop a sovereign default model with migration and capital accumulation. The model has a two-way feedback. Default risk lowers workers’ welfare and induces emigration, which in turn intensifies default risk by lowering tax base and investment. Compared with a no-migration model, our model produces higher default risk, lower investment, and a more profound and prolonged recession. We find that migration accounts for almost all of the lack of recovery in GDP during the recent Spanish debt crisis.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60027165","afid":"60027165","affilname":"University of Rochester","affiliation-city":"Rochester","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8544896700","authid":"8544896700","authname":"Alessandria G.","surname":"Alessandria","given-name":"George","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027165"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55682653787","authid":"55682653787","authname":"Bai Y.","surname":"Bai","given-name":"Yan","initials":"Y.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027165"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57216660198","authid":"57216660198","authname":"Deng M.","surname":"Deng","given-name":"Minjie","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60027165"}]}],"authkeywords":"Capital accumulation | European debt crisis | International capital flows | Migration | Sovereign default","source-id":"17555","fund-acr":"NSFC","fund-no":"71661137007","fund-sponsor":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85083107216"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85083107216?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85083107216&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85083107216&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0304393220300362"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85083107216","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85083107216","eid":"2-s2.0-85083107216","dc:title":"Comment on “The effect of migration policy on growth, structural change, and regional inequality in China”, by Hao, Sun, Tombe and Zhu","dc:creator":"Leight J.","prism:publicationName":"Journal of Monetary Economics","prism:issn":"03043932","prism:volume":"113","prism:pageRange":"135-137","prism:coverDate":"2020-08-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"August 2020","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.jmoneco.2020.03.007","pii":"S0304393220300362","dc:description":"© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

In the model, the observational return to migration confounds the urban premium and the individual benefits of migrants, and is not directly informative about the welfare gain from lowering migration costs.
