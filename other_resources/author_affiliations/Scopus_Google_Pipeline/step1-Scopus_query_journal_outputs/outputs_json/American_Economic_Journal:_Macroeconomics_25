We document that the United States and other G7 economies have been characterized by an increasingly negative business-cycle asymmetry over the last three decades. This finding can be explained by the concurrent increase in the financial leverage of households and firms. To support this view, we devise and estimate a dynamic general equilibrium model with collateralized borrowing and occasionally binding credit constraints. Improved access to credit increases the likelihood that financial constraints become nonbinding in the face of expansionary shocks, allowing agents to freely substitute intertemporally. Contractionary shocks, however, are further amplified by drops in collateral values, since constraints remain binding. As a result, booms become progressively smoother and more prolonged than busts. Finally, in line with recent empirical evidence, financially driven expansions lead to deeper contractions, as compared with equally sized nonfinancial expansions.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60030840","afid":"60030840","affilname":"Københavns Universitet","affiliation-city":"Copenhagen","affiliation-country":"Denmark"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022020","afid":"60022020","affilname":"University of Warwick","affiliation-city":"Coventry","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57216109465","authid":"57216109465","authname":"Jensen H.","surname":"Jensen","given-name":"Henrik","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030840"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/41762211700","authid":"41762211700","authname":"Petrella I.","surname":"Petrella","given-name":"Ivan","initials":"I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022020"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55957366100","authid":"55957366100","authname":"Ravn S.H.","surname":"Ravn","given-name":"Soren Hove","initials":"S.H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030840"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/26648971400","authid":"26648971400","authname":"Santoro E.","surname":"Santoro","given-name":"Emiliano","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60030840"}]}],"source-id":"19900191885","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85078893976"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85078893976?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85078893976&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85078893976&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85078893976","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85078893976","eid":"2-s2.0-85078893976","dc:title":"Multidimensional skill mismatch","dc:creator":"Guvenen F.","prism:publicationName":"American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics","prism:issn":"19457707","prism:eIssn":"19457715","prism:volume":"12","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"210-244","prism:coverDate":"2020-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 January 2020","prism:doi":"10.1257/mac.20160241","dc:description":"© 2020 American Economic Association. What determines the earnings of a worker relative to his peers in the same occupation? What makes a worker fail in one occupation but succeed in another? More broadly, what are the factors that determine the productivity of a worker-occupation match? To help answer questions like these, we propose an empirical measure of multidimensional skill mismatch that is based on the discrepancy between the portfolio of skills required by an occupation and the portfolio of abilities possessed by a worker for learning those skills. This measure arises naturally in a dynamic model of occupational choice and human capital accumulation with multidimensional skills and Bayesian learning about one's ability to learn skills. Not only does mismatch depress wage growth in the current occupation, it also leaves a scarring effect-by stunting skill acquisition-that reduces wages in future occupations. Mismatch also predicts different aspects of occupational switching behavior. We construct the empirical analog of our skill mismatch measure from readily available US panel data on individuals and occupations and find empirical support for these implications. The magnitudes of these effects are large: moving from the worst-to best-matched decile can improve wages by 11 percent per year for the rest of one's career.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60031004","afid":"60031004","affilname":"The University of Queensland","affiliation-city":"Brisbane","affiliation-country":"Australia"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029445","afid":"60029445","affilname":"University of Minnesota Twin Cities","affiliation-city":"Minneapolis","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026415","afid":"60026415","affilname":"Stony Brook University","affiliation-city":"Stony Brook","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016849","afid":"60016849","affilname":"University of Toronto","affiliation-city":"Toronto","affiliation-country":"Canada"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/17433808700","authid":"17433808700","authname":"Guvenen F.","surname":"Guvenen","given-name":"Fatih","initials":"F.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029445"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6508274033","authid":"6508274033","authname":"Kuruscu B.","surname":"Kuruscu","given-name":"Burhan","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016849"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194656590","authid":"57194656590","authname":"Tanaka S.","surname":"Tanaka","given-name":"Satoshi","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60031004"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35178695600","authid":"35178695600","authname":"Wiczer D.","surname":"Wiczer","given-name":"David","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026415"}]}],"source-id":"19900191885","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073119178"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073119178?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85073119178&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85073119178&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073119178","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85073119178","eid":"2-s2.0-85073119178","dc:title":"A macroeconomic framework for quantifying systemic risk","dc:creator":"He Z.","prism:publicationName":"American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics","prism:issn":"19457707","prism:eIssn":"19457715","prism:volume":"11","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"1-37","prism:coverDate":"2019-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 October 2019","prism:doi":"10.1257/mac.20180011","dc:description":"© 2019 American Economic Association. Systemic risk arises when shocks lead to states where a disruption in financial intermediation adversely affects the economy and feeds back into further disrupting financial intermediation. We present a macroeconomic model with a financial intermediary sector subject to an equity capital constraint. The novel aspect of our analysis is that the model produces a stochastic steady state distribution for the economy, in which only some of the states correspond to systemic risk states. The model allows us to examine the transition from \"normal\" states to systemic risk states. We calibrate our model and use it to match the systemic risk apparent during the 2007/2008 financial crisis. We also use the model to compute the conditional probabilities of arriving at a systemic risk state, such as 2007/2008. Finally, we show how the model can be used to conduct a macroeconomic \"stress test\" linking a stress scenario to the probability of systemic risk states.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60112748","afid":"60112748","affilname":"The University of Chicago Booth School of Business","affiliation-city":"Chicago","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020928","afid":"60020928","affilname":"Stanford Graduate School of Business","affiliation-city":"Stanford","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020337","afid":"60020337","affilname":"National Bureau of Economic Research","affiliation-city":"Cambridge","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35219923500","authid":"35219923500","authname":"He Z.","surname":"He","given-name":"Zhiguo","initials":"Z.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60112748"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020337"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202703813","authid":"57202703813","authname":"Krishnamurthy A.","surname":"Krishnamurthy","given-name":"Arvind","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020337"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020928"}]}],"source-id":"19900191885","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073117158"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073117158?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85073117158&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85073117158&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073117158","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85073117158","eid":"2-s2.0-85073117158","dc:title":"\"Whatever it takes\" is all you need: Monetary policy and debt fragility","dc:creator":"Camous A.","prism:publicationName":"American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics","prism:issn":"19457707","prism:eIssn":"19457715","prism:volume":"11","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"38-81","prism:coverDate":"2019-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 October 2019","prism:doi":"10.1257/mac.20170167","dc:description":"© 2019 American Economic Association.

We study long-run correlations between safe real interest rates in the United States and over 30 variables that have been hypothesized to influence real rates. The list of variables is motivated by an intertermporal IS equation, by models of aggregate savings and investment, and by reduced-form studies. We use annual data, mostly from 1890 to 2016. We find that safe real interest rates are correlated as expected with demographic measures. For example, the long-run correlation with labor force hours growth is positive, which is consistent with overlapping generations models. For another example, the long-run correlation with the proportion of 40 to 64 year-olds in the population is negative. This is consistent with standard theory where middle-aged workers are high savers who drive down real interest rates. In contrast to standard theory, we do not find productivity to be positively correlated with real rates. Most other variables have a mixed relationship with the real rate, with long-run correlations that are statistically or economically large in some samples and by some measures but not in others.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032179","afid":"60032179","affilname":"University of Wisconsin-Madison","affiliation-city":"Madison","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018149","afid":"60018149","affilname":"Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland","affiliation-city":"Cleveland","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57209638738","authid":"57209638738","authname":"Lunsford K.","surname":"Lunsford","given-name":"Kurt G.","initials":"K.G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018149"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7401596903","authid":"7401596903","authname":"West K.","surname":"West","given-name":"Kenneth D.","initials":"K.D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032179"}]}],"source-id":"19900191885","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073110196"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073110196?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85073110196&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85073110196&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073110196","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85073110196","eid":"2-s2.0-85073110196","dc:title":"Slow post-financial crisis recovery and monetary policy","dc:creator":"Ikeda D.","prism:publicationName":"American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics","prism:issn":"19457707","prism:eIssn":"19457715","prism:volume":"11","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"82-112","prism:coverDate":"2019-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 October 2019","prism:doi":"10.1257/mac.20160048","dc:description":"© 2019 American Economic Association. Post-financial crisis recoveries tend to be slow and accompanied by slowdowns in total factor productivity (TFP) and permanent losses in GDP. To prevent them, how should monetary policy be conducted? We address this issue by developing a model with endogenous TFP growth in which an adverse financial shock can induce a slow recovery. In the model, a welfare-maximizing monetary policy rule features a strong response to output, and the welfare gain from output stabilization is much larger than when TFP expands exogenously. Moreover, inflation stabilization results in a sizable welfare loss, while nominal GDP stabilization works well, albeit causing high interest rate volatility.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60112314","afid":"60112314","affilname":"Bank of Japan, Tokyo","affiliation-city":"Chuo-ku","affiliation-country":"Japan"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36728932000","authid":"36728932000","authname":"Ikeda D.","surname":"Ikeda","given-name":"Daisuke","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60112314"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15769545300","authid":"15769545300","authname":"Kurozumi T.","surname":"Kurozumi","given-name":"Takushi","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60112314"}]}],"source-id":"19900191885","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073106787"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073106787?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85073106787&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85073106787&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073106787","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85073106787","eid":"2-s2.0-85073106787","dc:title":"Unemployment cycles","dc:creator":"Eeckhout J.","prism:publicationName":"American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics","prism:issn":"19457707","prism:eIssn":"19457715","prism:volume":"11","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"175-234","prism:coverDate":"2019-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 October 2019","prism:doi":"10.1257/mac.20180105","dc:description":"© 2019 American Economic Association. The labor market by itself can create cyclical outcomes, even in the absence of exogenous shocks. We propose a theory in which the search behavior of the employed has profound aggregate implications for the unemployed. There is a strategic complementarity between active on-the-job search and vacancy posting by firms, which leads to multiple equilibria: in the presence of sorting, active on-the-job search improves the quality of the pool of searchers. This encourages vacancy posting, which in turn makes costly on-thejob search more attractive-a self-fulfilling equilibrium. The model provides a rationale for the Jobless Recovery, the outward shift of the Beveridge curve during the boom and for pro-cyclical frictional wage dispersion. Central to the model's mechanism is the fact that the employed crowd out the unemployed when on-the-job search picks up during recovery. We also illustrate this mechanism in a stylized calibration exercise.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60105207","afid":"60105207","affilname":"Barcelona Graduate School of Economics","affiliation-city":"Barcelona","affiliation-country":"Spain"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022148","afid":"60022148","affilname":"University College London","affiliation-city":"London","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005455","afid":"60005455","affilname":"Yale University","affiliation-city":"New Haven","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7801473799","authid":"7801473799","authname":"Eeckhout J.","surname":"Eeckhout","given-name":"Jan","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60105207"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022148"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57211245349","authid":"57211245349","authname":"Lindenlaub I.","surname":"Lindenlaub","given-name":"Ilse","initials":"I.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005455"}]}],"source-id":"19900191885","fund-acr":"ERC","fund-no":"339186","fund-sponsor":"European Research Council","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073104252"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073104252?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85073104252&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85073104252&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85073104252","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85073104252","eid":"2-s2.0-85073104252","dc:title":"Optimal taxation with risky human capital","dc:creator":"Kapička M.","prism:publicationName":"American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics","prism:issn":"19457707","prism:eIssn":"19457715","prism:volume":"11","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"271-309","prism:coverDate":"2019-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 October 2019","prism:doi":"10.1257/mac.20160365","dc:description":"© 2019 American Economic Association.

Optimal forward guidance is the simple policy of keeping interest rates low for some optimally determined number of periods after the liquidity trap ends and moving to normal-times optimal policy thereafter.

The simple rule \"announce a duration of half of the trap's duration times the disruption\" is a good approximation, including in a medium-scale dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model. By anchoring expectations of Delphic agents (who mistake commitment for bad news), the simple rule is also often welfare-preferable to Odyssean commitment.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60024983","afid":"60024983","affilname":"Center for Economic and Policy Research","affiliation-city":"Washington, D.C.","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000239","afid":"60000239","affilname":"Université de Lausanne (UNIL)","affiliation-city":"Lausanne","affiliation-country":"Switzerland"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/24167844000","authid":"24167844000","authname":"Bilbiie F.O.","surname":"Bilbiie","given-name":"Florin O.","initials":"F.O.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000239"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60024983"}]}],"source-id":"19900191885","fund-acr":"IUF","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Institut Universitaire de France","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064742739"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064742739?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85064742739&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85064742739&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064742739","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85064742739","eid":"2-s2.0-85064742739","dc:title":"Monopoly power and endogenous product variety: Distortions and remedies","dc:creator":"Bilbiie F.O.","prism:publicationName":"American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics","prism:issn":"19457707","prism:eIssn":"19457715","prism:volume":"11","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"140-174","prism:coverDate":"2019-10-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 October 2019","prism:doi":"10.1257/mac.20170303","dc:description":"© 2019 American Economic Association.

Appropriate taxation schemes can restore optimality if they preserve entry incentives. Quantitatively, the welfare costs of each distortion by itself amounts to 2 to 5 percent of consumption.

We develop a dynamic general equilibrium model where heterogenous firms need cash and external liquid funds in their production process.

We rationalize these facts in a New-Keynesian model where heterogeneous beliefs introduce a trade-off in forward guidance policy: leveraging on the optimism of those who believe in monetary easing comes at the cost of inducing excess pessimism in non-believers.","citedby-count":"10","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60112497","afid":"60112497","affilname":"Federal Reserve Bank of Boston","affiliation-city":"Boston","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60109908","afid":"60109908","affilname":"Banque de France","affiliation-city":"Paris","affiliation-country":"France"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60108957","afid":"60108957","affilname":"Ecole d’Économie de Paris","affiliation-city":"Paris","affiliation-country":"France"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60068566","afid":"60068566","affilname":"École des hautes études commerciales de Paris","affiliation-city":"Jouy-en-Josas","affiliation-country":"France"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016621","afid":"60016621","affilname":"Centre for Economic Policy Research, London","affiliation-city":"London","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005819","afid":"60005819","affilname":"Bank for International Settlements","affiliation-city":"Basel","affiliation-country":"Switzerland"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55766175400","authid":"55766175400","authname":"Andrade P.","surname":"Andrade","given-name":"Philippe","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60112497"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55769370300","authid":"55769370300","authname":"Gaballo G.","surname":"Gaballo","given-name":"Gaetano","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60109908"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60108957"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016621"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202131499","authid":"57202131499","authname":"Mengus E.","surname":"Mengus","given-name":"Eric","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60068566"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6506676282","authid":"6506676282","authname":"Mojon B.","surname":"Mojon","given-name":"Benoît","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005819"}]}],"source-id":"19900191885","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85068136940"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85068136940?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85068136940&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85068136940&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85068136940","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85068136940","eid":"2-s2.0-85068136940","dc:title":"Is government spending at the zero lower bound desirable?","dc:creator":"Bilbiie F.","prism:publicationName":"American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics","prism:issn":"19457707","prism:eIssn":"19457715","prism:volume":"11","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"147-173","prism:coverDate":"2019-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 July 2019","prism:doi":"10.1257/mac.20150229","dc:description":"© 2019 American Economic Association.

We study the currency composition of sovereign debt in emerging economies through the lens of a model in which the government lacks commitment regarding debt and monetary policy. High levels of debt in local currency give rise to incentives to dilute debt repayment through currency depreciation. Governments tilt the currency composition of debt toward foreign currency to avoid inflationary costs and real exchange rate distortions, at the expense of forgoing the hedging properties of local currency debt. Our quantitative model is used to shed light on the recent dynamics of the currency composition of debt and on its cyclical behavior.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60025778","afid":"60025778","affilname":"University of Michigan, Ann Arbor","affiliation-city":"Ann Arbor","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021784","afid":"60021784","affilname":"New York University","affiliation-city":"New York","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194139944","authid":"57194139944","authname":"Ottonello P.","surname":"Ottonello","given-name":"Pablo","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60025778"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57195150965","authid":"57195150965","authname":"Perez D.J.","surname":"Perez","given-name":"Diego J.","initials":"D.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021784"}]}],"source-id":"19900191885","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85065927207"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85065927207?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85065927207&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85065927207&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85065927207","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85065927207","eid":"2-s2.0-85065927207","dc:title":"Failure to launch: Housing, debt overhang, and the inflation option","dc:creator":"Hedlund A.","prism:publicationName":"American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics","prism:issn":"19457707","prism:eIssn":"19457715","prism:volume":"11","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"228-274","prism:coverDate":"2019-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2019","prism:doi":"10.1257/MAC.20160371","dc:description":"© American Economic Journal: Applied Economics 2019. Can inflating away nominal mortgage liabilities effectively combat recessions? I address this question using a model of illiquid housing, endogenous credit supply, and equilibrium default. I show that, in an ordinary recession, temporarily raising the inflation target has only modest or even counterproductive effects. However, during episodes like the Great Recession, inflation effectively boosts house prices, consumption, and dramatically cuts foreclosures, but only when fixed-rate mortgages are the dominant instrument. The quantitative implications of inflation also vary if other nominal rigidities or demand externalities are present. In the cross section, inflation delivers especially large gains to highly leveraged homeowners.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60006173","afid":"60006173","affilname":"University of Missouri","affiliation-city":"Columbia","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57188656981","authid":"57188656981","authname":"Hedlund A.","surname":"Hedlund","given-name":"Aaron","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60006173"}]}],"source-id":"19900191885","fund-no":"649396","fund-sponsor":"Horizon 2020","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}
