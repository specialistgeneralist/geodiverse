To match aggregate consumption dynamics, macroeconomic models must generate \"excess smoothness\" in consumption expenditures. But microfounded models are calibrated to match micro data, which exhibit no \"excess smoothness. \" So standard microfounded models fail to match the macro smoothness facts. We show that the micro and macro evidence are both consistent with a microfounded model where consumers know their personal circumstances but have \"sticky expectations\" about the macroeconomy. Aggregate consumption sluggishness reflects consumers' imperfect attention to aggregate shocks. Our proposed degree of inattention has negligible utility costs because aggregate shocks constitute a tiny proportion of the uncertainty that consumers face.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032704","afid":"60032704","affilname":"European Central Bank","affiliation-city":"Frankfurt am Main","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023612","afid":"60023612","affilname":"Federal Reserve System","affiliation-city":"Washington, D.C.","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60023004","afid":"60023004","affilname":"University of Delaware","affiliation-city":"Newark","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60021406","afid":"60021406","affilname":"International Monetary Fund","affiliation-city":"Washington, D.C.","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005248","afid":"60005248","affilname":"Johns Hopkins University","affiliation-city":"Baltimore","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7101866161","authid":"7101866161","authname":"Carroll C.D.","surname":"Carroll","given-name":"Christopher D.","initials":"C.D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005248"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57202214386","authid":"57202214386","authname":"Crawley E.","surname":"Crawley","given-name":"Edmund","initials":"E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023612"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/26768335000","authid":"26768335000","authname":"Slacalek J.","surname":"Slacalek","given-name":"Jiri","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032704"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55153064800","authid":"55153064800","authname":"Tokuoka K.","surname":"Tokuoka","given-name":"Kiichi","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60021406"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56902090000","authid":"56902090000","authname":"White M.N.","surname":"White","given-name":"Matthew N.","initials":"M.N.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60023004"}]}],"source-id":"19900191885","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85088840003"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85088840003?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85088840003&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85088840003&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85088840003","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85088840003","eid":"2-s2.0-85088840003","dc:title":"The fall in global fertility: A quantitative model","dc:creator":"de Silva T.","prism:publicationName":"American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics","prism:issn":"19457707","prism:eIssn":"19457715","prism:volume":"12","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"77-109","prism:coverDate":"2020-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 July 2020","prism:doi":"10.1257/mac.20180296","dc:description":"© 2020, American Economic Association.

We parametrize the model using data on socioeconomic variables and information on funding for population-control policies aimed at affecting social norms and improving access to contraceptives.

First, with no treasury's support, sizeable (current or expected) balance sheet losses can undermine the central bank's solvency and should be resolved through an increase in inflation. Second, a central bank might also engineer higher inflation in the case it wants to limit or reduce losses because of political constraints or to seek more financial independence.

We find a substantial cost advantage in favor of issuing short bonds, even when considering some of the operational risks implied by cash flows and gross redemptions.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60026851","afid":"60026851","affilname":"University of Oxford","affiliation-city":"Oxford","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010057","afid":"60010057","affilname":"London Business School","affiliation-city":"London","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55793013700","authid":"55793013700","authname":"Ellison M.","surname":"Ellison","given-name":"Martin","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60026851"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55472472000","authid":"55472472000","authname":"Scott A.","surname":"Scott","given-name":"Andrew","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010057"}]}],"source-id":"19900191885","fund-acr":"FP7","fund-no":"FP/2007-2013","fund-sponsor":"Seventh Framework Programme","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85088828977"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85088828977?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85088828977&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85088828977&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85088828977","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85088828977","eid":"2-s2.0-85088828977","dc:title":"Optimal capital requirements over the business and financial cycles","dc:creator":"Malherbe F.","prism:publicationName":"American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics","prism:issn":"19457707","prism:eIssn":"19457715","prism:volume":"12","prism:issueIdentifier":"3","prism:pageRange":"139-174","prism:coverDate":"2020-07-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 July 2020","prism:doi":"10.1257/mac.20160140","dc:description":"© 2020, American Economic Association. I study economies where banks do not fully internalize the social costs of their lending decisions, which leads to real overinvestment. The bank capital requirement that restores investment efficiency varies over time. During booms, more investment is desirable, so the banking sector must be allowed to expand. This suggests a loosening of the requirement. However, there is also more bank capital. Since the banking sector exhibits decreasing returns to scale, this suggests a tightening instead.

We assess the effects of a major land policy change on farm size and agricultural productivity using a quantitative model and micro-level data. We study the 1988 land reform in the Philippines that imposed a ceiling on land holdings, redistributed above-ceiling lands to landless and smallholder households, and severely restricted the transferability of the redistributed farmlands. We study this reform in the context of an industry model of agriculture with a nondegenerate distribution of farm sizes featuring an occupation decision and a technology choice of farm operators. In this model, the land reform can reduce agricultural productivity not only by misallocating resources across farmers but also by distorting farmers' occupation and technology decisions. The model, calibrated to prereform farm-level data in the Philippines, implies that on impact, the land reform reduces average farm size by 34 percent and agricultural productivity by 17 percent. The government assignment of land and the ban on its transfer are key for the magnitude of the results since a market allocation of the above-ceiling land produces about one-third of the size and productivity effects. These results emphasize the potential role of land market efficiency for misallocation and productivity in the agricultural sector.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033420","afid":"60033420","affilname":"York University","affiliation-city":"Toronto","affiliation-country":"Canada"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016849","afid":"60016849","affilname":"University of Toronto","affiliation-city":"Toronto","affiliation-country":"Canada"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23768212500","authid":"23768212500","authname":"Adamopoulos T.","surname":"Adamopoulos","given-name":"Tasso","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033420"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006790368","authid":"7006790368","authname":"Restuccia D.","surname":"Restuccia","given-name":"Diego","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016849"}]}],"source-id":"19900191885","fund-acr":"SSHRC","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85089285949"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85089285949?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85089285949&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85089285949&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85089285949","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85089285949","eid":"2-s2.0-85089285949","dc:title":"Bond convenience yields and exchange rate dynamics","dc:creator":"Valchev R.","prism:publicationName":"American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics","prism:issn":"19457707","prism:eIssn":"19457715","prism:volume":"12","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"124-166","prism:coverDate":"2020-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 April 2020","prism:doi":"10.1257/mac.20170391","dc:description":"© 2020, American Economic Association.

I study optimal monetary policy in a sticky-price economy wherein households precautionary-save against uninsured, endogenous unemployment risk. In this economy greater unemployment risk raises desired savings, causing aggregate demand to fall and feed back to greater unemployment risk. This deflationary spiral is constrained inefficient and calls for an accommodative monetary policy response: after a contractionary aggregate shock the policy rate should be kept significantly lower and for longer than in the perfect-insurance benchmark. For example, the usual prescription obtained under perfect insurance of a hike in the policy rate in the face of a bad supply (i.e., productivity or cost-push) shock is easily overturned. The optimal policy breaks the deflationary spiral and takes the dynamics of the imperfect-insurance economy close to that of the perfect-insurance benchmark.

Using cohorts of flag removals, we find that the MPC was 20 to 30 percent higher during the Great Recession, increased during the 2001 recession, and is positively correlated with the local unemployment rate.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60138820","afid":"60138820","affilname":"Kellogg School of Management Northwestern University","affiliation-city":"Evanston","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60116524","afid":"60116524","affilname":"Questrom School of Business","affiliation-city":"Boston","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60020337","afid":"60020337","affilname":"National Bureau of Economic Research","affiliation-city":"Cambridge","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000745","afid":"60000745","affilname":"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","affiliation-city":"Urbana","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/37049754300","authid":"37049754300","authname":"Gross T.","surname":"Gross","given-name":"Tal","initials":"T.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60116524"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020337"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/12344783300","authid":"12344783300","authname":"Notowidigdo M.J.","surname":"Notowidigdo","given-name":"Matthew J.","initials":"M.J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020337"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60138820"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56641933900","authid":"56641933900","authname":"Wang J.","surname":"Wang","given-name":"Jialan","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60020337"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000745"}]}],"source-id":"19900191885","fund-no":"18096","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85089269618"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85089269618?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85089269618&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85089269618&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85089269618","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85089269618","eid":"2-s2.0-85089269618","dc:title":"Consumer imperfect information and endogenous price rigidity","dc:creator":"L'Huillier J.P.","prism:publicationName":"American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics","prism:issn":"19457707","prism:eIssn":"19457715","prism:volume":"12","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"94-123","prism:coverDate":"2020-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 April 2020","prism:doi":"10.1257/mac.20170203","dc:description":"© 2020, American Economic Association. This paper studies the propagation of monetary shocks in an economy featuring a strategic microfoundation for price rigidities. Following an aggregate shock to money, most consumers are initially uninformed. The market for goods is decentralized. Firms are better off delaying the adjustment of prices until enough consumers learn. At the same time, consumers learn from firms that have adjusted prices. The implied endogenous information diffusion follows a Bernoulli differential equation, implying a nonlinear path of learning. Nonlinear learning implies hump-shaped dynamics of output and inflation. A quantitative exercise suggests that these dynamics can be sizable and persistent.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60016247","afid":"60016247","affilname":"Brandeis University","affiliation-city":"Waltham","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "1", "$" :"1"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55138532800","authid":"55138532800","authname":"L'Huillier J.P.","surname":"L'Huillier","given-name":"Jean Paul","initials":"J.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60016247"}]}],"source-id":"19900191885","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85089266983"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85089266983?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85089266983&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85089266983&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85089266983","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85089266983","eid":"2-s2.0-85089266983","dc:title":"Implications of labor market frictions for risk aversion and risk premia","dc:creator":"Swanson E.T.","prism:publicationName":"American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics","prism:issn":"19457707","prism:eIssn":"19457715","prism:volume":"12","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"194-240","prism:coverDate":"2020-04-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 April 2020","prism:doi":"10.1257/mac.20170446","dc:description":"© 2020, American Economic Association.

Model predictions depend crucially on the policy response of multinationals' investment in technology capital, accumulated know-how from investments in R&D, brands, and organizations used simultaneously in their domestic and foreign operations.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60029445","afid":"60029445","affilname":"University of Minnesota Twin Cities","affiliation-city":"Minneapolis","affiliation-country":"United States"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60022793","afid":"60022793","affilname":"University of Richmond","affiliation-city":"Richmond","affiliation-country":"United States"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "2", "$" :"2"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55942109100","authid":"55942109100","authname":"McGrattan E.","surname":"McGrattan","given-name":"Ellen R.","initials":"E.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60029445"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57210284069","authid":"57210284069","authname":"Waddle A.","surname":"Waddle","given-name":"Andrea","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60022793"}]}],"source-id":"19900191885","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85078953725"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85078953725?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85078953725&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85078953725&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85078953725","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85078953725","eid":"2-s2.0-85078953725","dc:title":"The collateral composition channel","dc:creator":"Boissay F.","prism:publicationName":"American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics","prism:issn":"19457707","prism:eIssn":"19457715","prism:volume":"12","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"41-75","prism:coverDate":"2020-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"1 January 2020","prism:doi":"10.1257/mac.20170097","dc:description":"© 2020 American Economic Association. Wholesale financial markets reallocate deposits. Because of incentive problems, these flows are limited by endogenous collateral constraints. The composition of collateral matters. The use of inside collateral creates a \"collateral pyramid\": cash flows from one loan are pledged to secure another. Outside collateral, such as treasuries, stabilizes the pyramid. Through collateral pyramids the financial sector sustains a large volume of reallocation across banks, but at the cost of systemic panics. During panics, the safe asset creation process stalls, the pyramid collapses, collateral becomes scarce.

Agents produce an initial forecast based on heterogeneous priors and are heterogeneously \"inattentive. \" Updaters use Bayes' rule and interpret public information using possibly heterogeneous models.
